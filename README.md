## About The Project

This project is an interactive dashboard that allows users to adjust sliders for various feline personality traits (like Fearfulness, Playfulness, and Human Sociability) and select common behaviors. As you adjust the controls, the application uses an interpolation algorithm to calculate and recommend the cat breed that best matches your preferences in real-time.

The interface is designed to be intuitive and engaging, providing a fun way to explore how different cat breeds vary in temperament.

### Key Features:

* **Real-time Breed Matching:** Instantly see which cat breed fits your chosen traits.
* **Interactive Controls:** Use sliders and selectable options to define your ideal cat's personality and behavior.
* **Trait Locking:** Lock specific traits you're certain about while allowing others to be interpolated.
* **Responsive Design:** Fully functional on both desktop and mobile devices.

> For our project, we designed a fun and interactive dashboard based on a cat dataset. At first glance, it shows simple summaries of gender and age. Off to the side, there’s a playful illustration of different cats—and when you hover over any one of them, you get to see their unique details like weight, breed, and personality traits. We also added correlation graphs and a radar chart to explore how behavior and personality vary across different breeds, making the data both insightful and engaging.

## Dataset and Citation

This visualization is based on a subset of data from a comprehensive feline behavior and personality survey. The original dataset contained information on over 4,300 cats. For this project, we selected data for approximately 1,528 cats across 7 distinct breeds to focus our visualization.

### Original Dataset Credit:

We extend our sincere gratitude to the authors of the original dataset for making their work publicly available.
